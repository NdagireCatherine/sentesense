Use the command npm init -y for the backend to initialise the developmnet<br>
Then use the following commands:
**npm install express -> npm install nodemon --save-dev**<br>
Create a server. **js file, controller folder, route folder** and the database

Moving on to the front end<br>
npm create-react-app (app name)<br>
If you already have the package.json file in your directory use the command: **npm install** and one will gain most of the dependencies required.
The next steps are to create the necesssary files and folders under the Src folders to turn it from a basic react front end application into a custom project in this case a personal finance app

This web application has been designed to empower individuals to manage their personal finances by constantly tracking their income and expenses thus help helping to make informed financial decisions and achieve a higher degree of financial freedom
